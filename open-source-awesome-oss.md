# Awesome open-source alternatives

Found [awesome-oss-alternatives](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) repo. It gathered big amount of open-source alternatives for well-known products. Repo with references to other repos) Here's the list of products which could be familiar to you: Zoom, Firebase, Figma, Shopify, AWS, Notion, Postman and bunch of others. I haven't checked in detail, but some of them looks nice. Not 100 percent match, but anyway good way to learn how other products implemented. 

Special thanks for Yerkebulan, who shared this and some other interesting sources. I highly appreciate it. Others: feel free to share helpful/interesting stuff too.
