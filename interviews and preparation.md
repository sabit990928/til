# Interviews and Preparation

This post partly sponsored by [Yerke](https://t.me/yerkbn). There are 2 resources which we found interesting.

**First one** - [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) repo(200k stars). Actually "Coding Interview" related part is not that interesting for me) But anyway it's a huge knowledge base. It has bunch of topics and resources. I found there some gamification element, because author asks you to mark topics as they passed in your roadmap.

- [ ] Unmarked
- [x] Marked

You should fork the repo and keep your repo synced with original repo. Also author has good enough [blog](https://startupnextdoor.com/).

**Second one** - [Interviews.school](https://interviews.school) site which is made by one of the kazakh developers. It has good ui, where you can do _marking as done_ related mechanisms. Lesser content, but anyway I found it interesting and helpful too. Fun fact, most of my relatives have already knew about this resource when I shared it with them.
