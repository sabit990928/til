# Notion Renderer

Firstly, Notion has a [doc](https://developers.notion.com/docs) for developers. Still in beta, but long story short after some manipulation you can use it as a DB for your needs. 

Secondly, there's a [NotionRenderer](https://github.com/cloveapp/notion_renderer) repo written in Elixir, which allows you to render notion API blocks into HTML. There's still bunch of stuff to do, but I empathize that author because had familiar experience. I used [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) as markdown(rich text) for CMS and know that it could be pain in the ass. Editor.js is truly awesome, but in that period it didn't have view mode and we rerendered data/blocks to actual HTML which should be more or less similar to original(don't what's the current situation).

Personally, I enjoy using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and maybe will try to play around with it's API.
