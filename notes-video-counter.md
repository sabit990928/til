Recently faced to [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0) of author called Tom Scott. He made a feature that reads video viewers count and updates video title via Youtube API(Application Programming Interface). It works for now, but maybe won't in future. Maybe he'll fix it, maybe not.

There are some notes/quotes from the video: 

> Entropy, the steady decline into disorder that’s a fundamental part of the universe.

> Try to make sure the things you’re working on push us in the right direction. They don’t have to be big projects, they might just have an audience of one. And even if they don’t last: try to make sure they leave something positive behind.

> The code in never the important part.
