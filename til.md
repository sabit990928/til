# TIL

Sorry for tautology, but the recent thing which I learned is "Today I Learned". The main idea is to save a collection of things which I(author) learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. Then it will work as a knowledge base. 

I think it has relation with "Kaizen" technique too, because the main idea there about always making little steps, progress. Engineering is craftsmanship. Sometime we do interesting stuff at job or read about useful feature. I think TIL is good thing to document all that stuff. It's usually lesser than a blog post and mostly used to write about one specific thing. The man who inspired me creates directories as "Ubuntu", "Elixir", "Javascript" and keeps each til under specific folder. He tries to write each til lesser than 200 characters. 

In my case I think it's early to divide it into directories, so I'll try to differentiate that specific things on file naming to structure it somehow. It would be good to write one til per day, but I realize that there could be cases when I have nothing to write(which is bad) or just won't have access(connection, laptop, etc). It's under public [repo](https://github.com/sabit990928/til). Feel free to open PR with typo fixes or some other stuff.
