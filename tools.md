# Tools

Should be the quick one. There are some tools which I found interesting, I have seen some of their analogues previously, but also some of them new to me.

- [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/): it has bunch of functionality, but recent use case was about chat addition to the webpage. Analogue of Jivosite I think.
- [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/): an agile project management and product roadmaps solution, natively integrated into GitHub(copy/paste). You can integrate it with github repo and create board based on github issues. All that in progress/todo columns with some additional features to issue.
- [StatusHero](https://statushero.com/): allows you to write daily standups in written form. Can be integrated with slack. Analogue of Geekbot. I think Geekbot is much better.
- [Tuple](https://tuple.app/): makes pair programming much easier. MacOS only. Haven't tried yet. Analogue of LiveShare extension in VSCode.
- 1password: browser extension to manage your password. Seems good, have some interesting functionalities, but I haven't used it properly.
