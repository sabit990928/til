# Design: Image quality

Initially I wasn't planned to write about design related stuff, but while making weekly TIL digest I was faced to the problem when my elements from Figma was exported in low quality.

I tried both `png` and `jpg` formats, but both didn't work for me. At least extension wasn't the reason. I also searched for some plugins with no success. Then I found out that when you select `1x`, `2x`, `4x` related stuff quality of exportable elements will increase too. I though that this functionality mostly used by designers for different scales of icon.
