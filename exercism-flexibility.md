# Exercism as a way to solve production related problems

The first problem in [Exercism](https://exercism.org) was about helper functions to prepare some dish. Solution is based on not only output of 1 function, it requires several functions to return proper results. I found familiarities with real life development. Kind of helper functions which do one specific thing. 

Another interesting fact. Till version 3 there wasn't own editor and community solved problems by submitting solutions from CLI. You can solve it in both ways now. Haven't tested yet, but [installed](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally) locally for now.
