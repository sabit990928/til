### Compiling code in a file

Run console by typing `iex`. Obvious

Then run command below depend on your file's location:

```elixir
iex(1)> c "freelancer_rates.ex"
[FreelancerRates]
```

But without slash, commeee on. c, then file's location. In quotes. Double quotes. Maybe one more example?

Kidding me?)

```elixir
iex(3)> c "foo/bar/awesome.ex"
[Awesome]
```

c should mean compile btw. Probably you can type full `compile ....`, but I don't know it. Today...
