# Philosophies of Pragmatic Programmer

Fun story. I was in a way to sleep and asked myself 'Is there anything new what you learned today?'. Actually there wasn't that much, so I decided to read the PP book first and go to sleep)

That's there's mostly quotes, notes and thoughts. 

>Youâ€™re here because you know you can become a better developer and help others become better as well.

Help others become better was the reason of starting blog and adventure with #til.

>Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility for everything they do.

I think it's all clear there and it's not only related to programming.

>Learning is a continuous and ongoing process.

Yeah, #til helps me with it.

One of the topics called 'It's Your Life' with several advices on it. 
>You Have Agency

Martin Fowler says: "you can change your organization or change your organization."
If there's some stuff what you can improve or change, try it first. If there's some things to ask, try to ask first. If all above don't work as expected you can change your organization)
