# Visa & Immigration

I'm not really willing to relocate for now, but it's the topic that I read yesterday. Read about what's the proper questions before relocating, what countries to look for as software engineers. 
There are usually 3 regions:
- US: H1B, J1, L1, F1 visas. 'No matter what company applies for you or what your background is, to get an H1B visa you enter the random lottery'. Long processing time. 

- Canada: usually straightforward to get a work visa. Have some big companies too.

- Europe:  a lot of big tech companies. Most of the things depend on a country. Taxes vary. Can get a work visa in 2-3 months. 

# Notion: delay on allowing access

I have 2 workspaces. Different emails on each. Shared one board with several cards on it. Board was visible for another account. More precisely, only the board title and amount of cards in each column were visible, without any cards inside. Strange behavior. Wasn't clear what should I do with it, then when I checked that board again today, it appeared with whole data on it. Btw, noticed it in the desktop version. Didn't test it on the web, mobile.
